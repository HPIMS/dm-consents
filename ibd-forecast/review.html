                <h2>SUMMARY OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY:</h2>
                <p>
                    In medicine there are many unanswered questions. A research study is when scientists try to answer a question about something that we don’t know enough about. Participation in a research study may or may not directly help you or others. Participation is entirely voluntary. It is completely up to you whether or not you take part. You can also change your mind at any time and it will not affect your ability to get medical care within the Mount Sinai Health System.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this research study is to assess whether markers measured from wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch or Fitbit, can identify the development and predict the development of a flare of ulcerative colitis.
                </p>
                <p>If you choose to participate, you will be asked to download the study app to your smartphone and wear your wearable device for the duration of the study. In addition, you will be asked to complete surveys throughout the study, and then at the time of worsening symptoms. There is no cost associated with participating in the study. To participate in this study you must own a smartphone and a wearable device. Some participants at Mount Sinai will be provided with an Apple Watch to use for the duration of the study, if they have an iPhone.</p>

                <p>
                    The main risks to you if you choose to participate is loss of confidentiality. Participating in this research will not benefit you. If you are interested in learning more about this study, please continue to read below.

                <p>
                    Sometimes, physicians/researchers receive payments for consulting or similar work performed for industry. Effective September 2014 Mount Sinai reviews only payments to an individual totaling more than $5,000 a year per entity when determining potential conflicts of interest. If you have questions regarding industry relationships, we encourage you to talk your physician/researcher or visit our website at http://icahn.mssm.edu/ where Mount Sinai publicly discloses the industry relationships of our faculty.

                    As you take part in this research project it will be necessary for the research team and others to use and share some of your private protected health information. Consistent with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we are asking your permission to receive, use and share that information.
                </p>
                <h5 class="underlined">What protected health information is collected and used in this study, and might also be shared with others?</h5>
                <p>
                    As part of this research project, the research team at the hospital(s) involved in the research will collect your name, date of birth, dates related to your medical history including diagnoses, admissions, discharges, procedures, imaging and potential surgeries.
                </p>
                <p>During the study the researchers will gather information by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your completion of questionnaires explained in the description section of this consent.</li>
                    <li>Your using a wearable device.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="underlined">Why is your protected health information being used?</h5>
                <p>
                    Your personal contact information is important to be able to contact you during the study. Your health information and the results of any tests and procedures being collected as part of this research study will be used for the purpose of this study as explained earlier in this consent form. The results of this study could be published or presented at scientific meetings, lectures, or other events, but would not include any information that would let others know who you are, unless you give separate permission to do so.
                </p>
                <p>The Principal Investigator may also use and share the results of these tests and procedures to treat you in collaboration with others in the Mount Sinai Health System.</p>
                <p>
                    The research team and other authorized members of The Mount Sinai Health System (“Mount Sinai”) workforce may use and share your information to ensure that the research meets legal, institutional or accreditation requirements. For example, the School’s Program for the Protection of Human Subjects is responsible for overseeing research on human subjects, and may need to see your information. If you receive any payments for taking part in this study, the Mount Sinai Finance Department may need your name, address, social security number, payment amount, and related information for tax reporting purposes. If the research team uncovers abuse,
                    neglect, or reportable diseases, this information may be disclosed to appropriate authorities.
                </p>
                <h5 class="underlined">Who, outside Mount Sinai, might receive your protected health information?</h5>
                <p>As part of the study, the Principal Investigator, study team and others in the Mount Sinai workforce may disclose your protected health information, including the results of the research study tests and procedures, to the following people or organizations: (It is possible that there may be changes to the list during this research study; you may request an up-to-date list at any time by contacting the Principal Investigator.)</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Human Research Protection.</li>
                    <li>The National Institute of Health.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, you will not be identified by name or using other direct personal identifier unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by law. Some records and information disclosed may be identified with a unique code number. The Principal Investigator will ensure that the key to the code will be kept in a locked file, or will be securely stored electronically. The code will not be used to link the information back to you without your permission, unless the law requires it, or rarely if the Institutional Review Board allows it after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy. It is possible that a sponsor or their representatives, a data coordinating office, a contract research organization, may come to inspect your records. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected, the information leaving the institution will be stripped of direct identifiers. Additionally, when applicable, the monitors, auditors, the IRB, the Office of Human Subjects Protection (OHRP) of the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be granted direct access to your medical records for verification of the research procedures and data. OHRP and FDA are authorized to remove information with identifiers if necessary to complete their task. By signing this document you are authorizing this access. We may publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your name and other identifying information confidential.
                </p>
                <h5 class="underlined">For how long will Mount Sinai be able to use or disclose your protected health information?</h5>

                <h5 class="underlined">Will you be able to access your records?</h5>
                <p>
                    During your participation in this study, you will have access to your medical record and any study information that is part of that record. The investigator is not required to release to you research information that is not part of your medical record.
                </p>
                <h5 class="underlined">Do you need to give us permission to obtain, use or share your health information?</h5>
                <p>
                    NO! If you decide not to let us obtain, use or share your health information you should not sign this form, and you will not be allowed to volunteer in the research study.
                    <span class="underlined">If you do not sign, it will not affect your treatment, payment or enrollment in any health plans or affect your eligibility for benefits.</span>

                <p>
                    You may withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected information for research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page. Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use your protected information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the study. Your health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization if you should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from being in the study. If you withdraw your permission to use your protected health information for research that means you will also be withdrawn from the research study, but standard medical care and any other benefits to which you are entitled will not be affected. You can also tell us you want to withdraw from the research study at any time without canceling the Authorization to use your data.
