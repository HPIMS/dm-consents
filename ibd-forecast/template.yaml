    We are inviting you to participate in the IBD Forecast study. The main goal of this study is to see whether markers from wearable devices can predict flares or worsening of inflammatory bowel disease. This study collects data from survey questions and your wearable device. If you have an iPhone you can choose to share any electronic health record data. This is optional.
    If you are interested in learning more about joining this study, this simple walk through will first see if you are eligible and then highlight the details of what participation will involve.
    After reading about the study, we will give you a short quiz to make sure that you understand what’s involved.

  - title: Study Tasks and Time Commitment
    image: /svgs/time.svg
    summary: |
      To participate in this study, we will ask you to:
      
        • Download and install the eHive app on your phone
        
        • Connect your wearable device to the eHive app
        
        • Complete study surveys in the eHive app


        Registering for the study and completing the tasks should take about 15 minutes. You can stop and restart where you left off at any time. Your participation in the study will vary each day. Most days it will require only 10-20 seconds to answer survey questions. Every 2 weeks you will be asked to answer slightly longer survey questions. This will take approximately 1 minute of your time.

    summary: |
      To protect your privacy, we use a random code instead of your name on your study data. Learn more about how your privacy and identity are protected.
    description: |
      We will work hard to protect your privacy. A random code instead of your name or other information that could identify you will be used on all your study data. Researchers will only analyze data without information that identifies you. Your study data will be coded and stored in a manner that keeps your information as safe as possible and prevents unauthorized people from getting to your data. Even with removal of your personal information and these procedures, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual. This risk, while very low, should still be considered before enrolling.
  - title: Data Collection and Use
    image: /svgs/data-collection.svg
    summary: |
      There are sensors in your phone and wearable device that can help assess activity and additional data, plus you may have a Health app or a device app on your phone which stores activity or additional data. Additionally, you will be asked to sync your wearable device with the study application. This is a requirement for participation in the study. We may follow up with a phone call or message from the study team after you’ve consented and registered for the study if this is not done or to provide assistance.   You can link your electronic health record data to the study to provide this information to the study team if you have an iPhone, however this is not required. Learn more about how data is gathered and used.
    description: |
      This study can also gather sensor data from your phone and your wearable device with your permission. You can choose not to do this and still participate in the study. We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, text messages, personal photos or websites visited. By signing this consent, you are giving permission to use your wearable device data, the survey data you provide, and any electronic health record data you choose to link to the study.  You are also giving permission for other researchers to access your data without identifiers, for future unrestricted research. This would be in a coded fashion, where your identifiers are masked and replaced with a unique code.
  - title: Re-Contacting
    image: /svgs/recontacting.svg
    summary: |
      By consenting to be part of this study you are consenting to be contacted in the future to be part of additional studies.
    description: |
      The research team may reach out to you in the future to see if you are interested in participating in future studies. Participation in future studies is optional.
  - title: Scientific Databases
    image: /svgs/scientific-databases.svg
    summary: |
      Some information from the analysis of your coded samples and your coded medical information like your age, sex, ethnic background, diagnosis and disease history, may be entered into one or more scientific databases available to other researchers inside and outside of Mount Sinai Health System. Your identifiable information (e.g. name, phone number, medical record number) will never be added to a scientific database without your approval.

    summary: |
      This study may not benefit participants or society.
    description: |
      The goal of the study is to understand if we can predict a future flare of inflammatory bowel disease from the information collected from wearable devices. This could benefit people with inflammatory bowel disease with improved control and prediction of their disease.
  - title: Potential Risks
    image: /svgs/risk.svg
    summary: |
      There always exists the potential for loss of private information.
    description: |
      There are procedures in place to minimize this risk. It is also possible that the application’s presence on your phone, the alerts or the reminders may be observed by someone other than the participant. Information on how we store your data may be found in the privacy section.
      You may incur standard data charges when using our app, depending on your service carrier.
  - title: Withdrawing
    image: /svgs/withdrawing.svg
    summary: |
      There will be no penalty if you decide not to take part in this study. You can withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.
      Learn more about withdrawing.
    description: |
      There will be no penalty to you if you decide not to take part in this study. To stop being in the study at any time, you may withdraw from the study within the app and/or contact the study team by email. If you withdraw from the study, we will stop collecting new data, but any data already collected will remain as part of the study. The study team may also withdraw you from the study at any time for any reason.
  - title: Confidentiality and Protected Information
    image: /svgs/confidentiality.svg

      As you take part in this research study, it will be necessary for the research team and others to use and share some of your private protected health information. Protected Health Information (PHI) include, for example: your name, address, telephone number, medical record number, date of birth, family history, your medical record, blood draw sample, etc.
      Your health information, along with results of any tests/procedures collected as part of this research study or regular clinical care, will be used for this study as explained earlier in this consent process. The results of this study could be published or presented at scientific meetings, lectures, etc., but would not include any information that would let others know who you are, unless you give separate permission to do so.
    description: |
      Consistent with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we are asking your permission to receive, use and share your Protected Health Information.
