            <h2>SUMMARY OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY:</h2>
            <p>
                In medicine there are many unanswered questions. A research study is when scientists try to answer a
                question about something that we don’t know enough about. Participation in a research study may or may
                not directly help you or others. Participation is entirely voluntary. It is completely up to you whether
                or not you take part. You can also change your mind at any time and it will not affect your ability to
                get medical care within the Mount Sinai Health System.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypertension (i .e. high blood pressure) is highly prevalent in adults worldwide and is the leading risk
                factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, the standard way to measure this condition is still quite
                cumbersome and requires a cuff-based device (you have likely experienced this cuff to measure blood
                pressure at the doctor’s office). With the surge of more comfortable wearables like smartwatches and
                armbands, blood pressure monitoring at home is becoming easier and can thus have the potential, to help
                prevent and monitor not only hypertension but also many other cardiovascular health risks. In this
                study, we will test wearable devices to see how they measure blood pressure compared to a medical-grade
                oscillometric device. At home monitoring of blood pressure (BP) could lead to better health outcomes,
                but we do not know how accurate some of these measurements are.
            </p>
            <p>If you choose to participate, you will be asked to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Download and install the eHive app on your phone.</li>
                <li>Connect a blood pressure monitor and two other wearable devices to the app and record your BP and
                    wearable data twice daily.</li>
                <li>Complete study surveys in the eHive app.</li>
                <li>Watch short videos that instruct you how to use the BP monitor and wearable devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As part of this study you will be given three devices, specifically the Withings BPM,
                Empatica E4, and Polar Verity. The data that is collected from the devices includes PPG signal (PPG
                signal can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue). We will also
                collect accelerometer (ACC), heart rate (HR), inter beat interval (IBI), skin tone as defined by the
                Fitzpatrick scale, and blood pressure data from the devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible that the device companies listed above may be collecting some data including, but also
                beyond what you share with the study. The data collected on blood pressure and from the wearable devices
                is a data feed that goes directly to the company’s cloud system. It is important that you understand the
                data that will be shared and make whatever changes you wish to limit the sharing. Those are data
                specific to the terms and conditions which the companies have set up with you. We urge you to look over
                the terms of agreement with Withings, Polar, and Empatica to see what types of data they collect on
                their device users. Our study team retrieves the data we need for the study, from their cloud system to
                conduct the research. At this point, the data does not leave Mt. Sinai servers. We do not share your BP
                data associated with your identity in anyway that would allow you to be matched to it.
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, the device companies listed here: Withings, Polar and Empatica may collect things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Identity data</span>, which means data which can directly identify you, such as
                    your email address, birth date, name, phone number, delivery address, etc.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Activity data </span>, which means your physical activities, such as number of
                    steps, distance travelled, number of calories burned, your weight, heart rate, blood pressure, heart
                    sound, temperature, etc.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Technical data</span>, which means data necessary for the use of the Products and
                    Services, such as Wi-Fi network, technical logs, date of Product activation, battery measurement,
                    manufacturing ID, debug technical information, and website cookies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We urge you to look at the terms and conditions yourself before you make a decision to join the study.

            <p><span class="bold">Study application:</span> It is also possible that Apple may be collecting some data
                through the information you provide on the research platform. This does not include health information,
                which is protected by this research study. There are data specific to Apple terms and conditions which
                Apple has set up with you upon download and participation in the study application (or any application
                that you chose to download). We urge you to look over the terms of agreement with Apple to see what
                types of data they collect on their app users.</p>
            <p>You will start using the eHive app after you have received your blood pressure and wearable devices in
                the mail. You will enter BP measurements for 7 days and then return the devices with the prepaid label
                contained in your packet.</p>
            <p>The main risks to you if you choose to participate are a loss of private information.</p>
            <p>There are no benefits to you if you participate in this study.</p>

            <h2>DESCRIPTION OF WHAT’S INVOLVED:</h2>
            <p>If you agree to participate in this research study, the following information describes what may be
                involved. This study is remote, meaning there are no visits or in person contacts required.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You will download the eHive app, complete the consent process.</li>
                <li>You will answer survey questions every day in the eHive app.</li>

                <li>You will link your BP and wearable devices to the study app once they arrive in the mail.</li>
                <li>You will enter your BP measurements and wearable data twice a day for 7 days.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Data from your BP and wearable devices includes your PPG signal, ACC, IBI, HR and blood pressure data.
                You will receive notifications to complete surveys and reminders through the study App to enter the
                measurements. These can be turned off by disabling App notifications. Additionally, study coordinators
                may reach out to you periodically to answer any questions by email and reinforce the study procedures.
                It is important that you do not skip a day of entering data.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there are any issues obtaining the data from your surveys, the eHive app or any of the devices, a
                research coordinator may reach out to you to assist in troubleshooting the issue. Since this study is
                completely remote, research coordinators may reach out to you to check in on how the study is going.
                This may occur once a day at most or not at all.

            <h2>USE OF YOUR DATA:</h2>
            <p>
                In the future, your identifiable information may be removed from the private information collected as
                part of this research. After this removal, the information will be used for future research studies and
                shared with other research teams for future research studies. You will not be informed of the details of
                specific research that is done with your medical information. That means that a research project might
                be done that you would not consent to if provided with the details of that research project.
            </p>
            <p>To do more powerful research, it is helpful for researchers to share information they get from studying
                data. They do this by putting it into one or more scientific databases, where it is stored along with
                information from other studies. Researchers can then study the combined information to learn even more
                about health and disease. If you agree to take part in this study, some of health information might be
                placed into one or more scientific databases. There are many different kinds of scientific databases;
                some are maintained by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or another institution, some are
                maintained by the federal government, and some are maintained by private companies. For example, the
                National Institutes of Health (an agency of the federal government) maintains a database called “dbGaP.”
                A researcher who wants to study the information must apply for permission to use the database. Different
                databases may have different ways of reviewing such requests. Researchers with an approved study may be
                able to see and use your information, along with that from many other people. Researchers will always
                have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information confidential, but there are risks
                associated with data collection and sharing. They are described in more detail in the risks section.</p>

            <h2>COSTS OR PAYMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM PARTICIPATION:</h2>
            <p>If you agree to take part in this research study, we will pay you with $25 after your participation on
                the first day with the device readings. You will receive another $25 once we receive the devices back
                from you. The total compensation is for $50.</p>
            <p>
                You should also know that it is possible that products may someday be developed with the help of your
                data, and there are no plans to share any profits from such products with you, regardless of whether
                your identifiable information is removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tax law may require the Mount Sinai Finance Department to report the amount of payment you receive from
                Mount Sinai to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other agencies, as applicable. Generally, this
                reporting would take place if you receive payments that equal $600 or more from Mount Sinai in a
                calendar year. You would be responsible for the payment of any tax that may be due.

                It is important to know that you may not get any benefit from taking part in this research. Others may
                not benefit either, but learning more about how blood pressure is collected through these devices could
                have an impact on the health of people in the future.

            <p>
                Sometimes, physicians/researchers receive payments for consulting or similar work performed for
                industry. Effective September 2014 Mount Sinai reviews only payments to an individual totaling more than
                $5,000 a year per entity when determining potential conflicts of interest. If you have questions
                regarding industry relationships, we encourage you to talk to your physician/researcher or visit our
                website at http://icahn.mssm.edu/ where Mount Sinai publicly discloses the industry relationships of our
                faculty.

                As you take part in this research project it will be necessary for the research team and others to use
                and share some of your private protected health information. Consistent with the federal Health
                Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we are asking your permission to receive, use and
                share that information.
            </p>
            <h5 class="underlined">What protected health information is collected and used in this study, and might also
                be shared with others?</h5>
            <p>
                As part of this research project, the research team at the hospital(s) involved in the research will
                collect your name, address and medical record number. The researchers will also get information from
                your medical record in the Mount Sinai Health System.
            </p>
            <p>During the study the researchers will gather information by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Asking survey questions through the eHive app.</li>
                <li>Collecting data gathered by the Withings BPM Connect, Empatica E4 and Polar Verity devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="underlined">Why is your protected health information being used?</h5>
            <p>
                Your personal contact information is important to be able to contact you during the study. Your health
                information and the results of any tests and procedures being collected as part of this research study
                will be used for the purpose of this study as explained earlier in this consent form. The results of
                this study could be published or presented at scientific meetings, lectures, or other events, but would
                not include any information that would let others know who you are, unless you give separate permission
                to do so.
            </p>
            <p>The Principal Investigator may also use and share the results of these tests and procedures to treat you
                in collaboration with others in the Mount Sinai Health System.</p>
            <p>
                The research team and other authorized members of The Mount Sinai Health System (“Mount Sinai”)
                workforce may use and share your information to ensure that the research meets legal, institutional or
                accreditation requirements. For example, the School’s Program for the Protection of Human Subjects is
                responsible for overseeing research on human subjects, and may need to see your information. If you
                receive any payments for taking part in this study, the Mount Sinai Finance Department may need your
                name, address, social security number, payment amount, and related information for tax reporting
                purposes. <span class="italic">If the research team uncovers abuse, neglect, or reportable diseases,
                    this information may be disclosed to appropriate authorities.</span>
            </p>
            <h5 class="underlined">Who, outside Mount Sinai, might receive your protected health information?</h5>
            <p>As part of the study, the Principal Investigator, study team and others in the Mount Sinai workforce may
                disclose your protected health information, including the results of the research study tests and
                procedures.</p>
            <p>
                In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, you will not be identified by name, social security number,
                address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier unless disclosure of the direct
                identifier is required by law. Some records and information disclosed may be identified with a unique
                code number. The Principal Investigator will ensure that the key to the code will be kept in a locked
                file, or will be securely stored electronically. The code will not be used to link the information back
                to you without your permission, unless the law requires it, or rarely if the Institutional Review Board
                allows it after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy. It is possible that a
                sponsor or their representatives, a data coordinating office, a contract research organization, may come
                to inspect your records. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected, the information leaving
                the institution will be stripped of direct identifiers. Additionally, when applicable, the monitors,
                auditors, the IRB, the Office of Human Subjects Protection (OHRP) of the Department of Health and Human
                Services as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be granted direct access to your medical
                records for verification of the research procedures and data. OHRP and FDA are authorized to remove
                information with identifiers if necessary to complete their task. By signing this document you are
                authorizing this access. We may publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your name
                and other identifying information confidential.
            </p>
            <h5 class="underlined">For how long will Mount Sinai be able to use or disclose your protected health
                information?</h5>
            <p>Your authorization for use of your protected health information for this specific study does not expire.
            </p>
            <h5 class="underlined">Will you be able to access your records?</h5>
            <p>
                During your participation in this study, you will have access to your medical record and any study
                information that is part of that record. The investigator is not required to release to you research
                information that is not part of your medical record.
            </p>
            <h5 class="underlined">Do you need to give us permission to obtain, use or share your health information?
            </h5>
            <p>
                NO! If you decide not to let us obtain, use or share your health information you should not sign this
                form, and you will not be allowed to volunteer in the research study.
                <span class="underlined">If you do not sign, it will not affect your treatment, payment or enrollment in
                    any health plans or affect your eligibility for benefits.</span>
            </p>
            <h5 class="underlined">Can you change your mind?</h5>
            <p>
                You may withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected information for
                research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page.
                Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use
                your protected information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the
                study. Your health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization if you
                should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from being in the study. If you withdraw your permission to
                use your protected health information for research that means you will also be withdrawn from the
                research study, but standard medical care and any other benefits to which you are entitled will not be
                affected. You can also tell us you want to withdraw from the research study at any time without
                canceling the Authorization to use your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important for you to understand that once information is disclosed to others outside Mount Sinai,
                the information may be re-disclosed and will no longer be covered by the federal privacy protection
                regulations. However, even if your information will no longer be protected by federal regulations, where
                possible, Mount Sinai has entered into agreements with those who will receive your information to
                continue to protect your confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
                If as part of this research project your medical records are being reviewed, or a medical history is
                being taken, it is possible that HIV-related information may be revealed to the researchers. If that is
                the case, the following information concerns you. If this research does not involve any review of
                medical records or questions about your medical history or conditions, then the following section may be
                ignored.
            </p>
            <h4 class="underlined">Notice Concerning HIV-Related Information</h4>
            <p>
                If you are authorizing the release of HIV-related information, you should be aware that the recipient(s)
                is (are) prohibited from re-disclosing any HIV-related information without your authorization unless
                permitted to
                do so under federal or state law. You also have a right to request a list of people who may receive or
                use your HIV-related information without authorization. If you experience discrimination because of the
                release or
                disclosure of HIV-related information, you may contact the New York State Division of Human Rights at
                (888) 392-3644 or the New York City Commission on Human Rights at (212) 306-5070. These agencies are
