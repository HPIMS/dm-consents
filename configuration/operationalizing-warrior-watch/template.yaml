    summary: |
      This surveillance program collects commonly measured markers from wearable devices, such as heart rate and heart rate variability (a calculation of the small differences in time between each heartbeat). This is the same information that is collected by the wearable device when purchased from a store. This information is collected continuously while you wear the device. A computer algorithm assesses the information collected from the device you are wearing and may be able to identify whether you are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus/have COVID-19. 
    
      This program is not meant to replace or supplement your medical care. It is a pilot program meant to potentially help identify health care workers who may be infected with the virus. If you do not feel well or have any symptoms, you should contact your health care provider and employee health services for further guidance. You should not assume that you do not have SARS-CoV-2 if you do not receive a notification from this program about potentially being infected. 
    
      If you are identified as potentially having a SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19, you will receive an email notifying you and with information about how to contact employee health services to arrange testing. 
    
    
      If you agree to take part in the pilot program you will be asked to perform the following:

      •	Wear your Apple Watch as much as possible. A minimum of 8 hours per day is recommended, however the more you wear the Apple Watch the better the algorithm may identify an infection.

      • Answer the few brief questions after you sign the consent form. Some of this information, such as your weight, height, age and sex, are part of the algorithm that helps identify potential infections.

      • Let us know if you test positive or negative for COVID-19 and if you have any symptoms.
