      <br><br>
      •	Connect the blood pressure monitor and the wearable devices you were given to the study app
      <br><br>
      •	Complete study surveys in the eHive app
      <br><br>
      •	Watch short videos that instruct you on how to use your blood pressure monitor and wearable devices

      To protect your privacy, we use a random code instead of your name on your study data. Learn more about how your privacy and identity are protected.
    description: |
      We will work hard to protect your privacy. A random code instead of your name or other information that could identify you will be used on all your study data. Researchers will only analyze data without information that identifies you. Your study data will be coded and stored in a manner that keeps your information as safe as possible and prevents unauthorized people from getting to your data. Even with removal of your personal information and these procedures, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual. This risk, while very low, should still be considered before enrolling.
  - title: Data Collection and Use
    image: /svgs/data-collection.svg
    summary: |
      You will be asked to sync your blood pressure monitor and wearable devices with the eHive app. This is a requirement for participation in this study. We may follow up with a phone call from the study team after you’ve consented and registered for the study if these are not done. Your contact information will be stored so we can re-contact you about future research studies, but this will not be linked to any health information you share with us for this study. Your contact information will not be used directly for the research. We will gather data from your study activities that allows us to assess whether you have been compliant with the study steps. Learn more about how data is gathered and used.
    description: |
      We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, text messages, personal photos or websites visited. If you don’t wish to be re-contacted, you can use a toggle built into the app to opt out. By signing this consent, you are giving permission to connect your survey, and device data. You are also giving permission for other researchers to access your data without identifiers, for future unrestricted research. This would be in a coded fashion, where your identifiers are masked and replaced with a unique code.
  - title: Re-Contacting
    image: /svgs/recontacting.svg
    summary: |
      By consenting to be part of this study you are consenting to be contacted in the future to be part of additional studies.

    summary: |
      Some information from the analysis of your coded samples and your coded medical information like your age, sex, bmi, ethnic background, diagnosis and disease history, may be entered into one or more scientific databases available to other researchers inside and outside of Mount Sinai. Your identifiable information (e.g. name, phone number, medical record number) will never be added to a scientific database without your approval.
