    summary: |
      To participate in this study, we will ask you to:
      
      •	Connect your Apple Watch to the eHive app (if you don’t  have an Apple Watch you will be provided with one)
      
      •	Complete study surveys in the eHive app
      
      •	Watch short videos each week that are in the eHive app to learn about the interventions we are using and how to apply them to your life
      
      •	Download the HeartMath app and use the provided ear sensor which will be sent to you
      
      •	Use the Heartmath app with the ear sensor for 5 minutes each day, for 5 weeks.
      
      •	Apply the techniques you learn during these sessions to your day-to-day life.
      
      •	Continue to answer questions in the eHive app for 17 weeks after you begin the intervention

      You will start using the HeartMath app and intervention after you have worn your Apple Watch for 7 days.

      This study will take place completely on your phone by using the Apple Watch, eHive app and HeartMath app. 

      Registering for the study and answering the first set of questions should take about 15 minutes. You can stop and restart where you left off at any time. Your participation in this study will vary each day and may include up to 5 minutes of practice with the HeartMath intervention, answering less than 1 minute of survey questions per day, and some days watching short videos.

    summary: |
      To protect your privacy, we use a random code instead of your name on your study data. Learn more about how your privacy and identity are protected.
    description: |
      We will work hard to protect your privacy. A random code instead of your name or other information that could identify you will be used on all your study data. Researchers will only analyze data without information that identifies you. Your study data will be coded and stored in a manner that keeps your information as safe as possible and prevents unauthorized people from getting to your data. Even with removal of your personal information and these procedures, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual. This risk, while very low, should still be considered before enrolling.
  - title: Data Collection and Use
    image: /svgs/data-collection.svg
    summary: |
      There are sensors in your phone that can help assess activity, plus HealthKit on your phone which will store activity data. Additionally, you will be asked to sync your Apple Watch with the study application and download the HeartMath App. This is a requirement for participation in this study. We may follow up with a phone call from the study team after you’ve consented and registered for the study if these are not done. We may also collect data from your medical record at Mount Sinai for research purposes only. Your contact information will be stored so we can re-contact you about future research studies. Your contact information will not be used directly for the research. We will gather data from HeartMath that allows us to assess whether you have been compliant with the intervention. Learn more about how data is gathered and used. 
    description: |
      This study can also gather sensor data from your phone and your Apple Watch with your permission. You can choose not to do this and still participate in the study. We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, text messages, personal photos or websites visited. If you don’t wish to be re-contacted, you can use a toggle built into the app to opt out. By signing this consent, you are giving permission to connect your survey, HeartMath and device data to the information in your health record, pulled from different Mount Sinai data registries. Data used may also include genetics data, for instance, if you’ve participated or will participate in the BioMe biobank program at Mount Sinai. You are also giving permission for other researchers to access your data without identifiers, for future unrestricted research. This would be in a coded fashion, where your identifiers are masked and replaced with a unique code. 
  - title: Re-Contacting
    image: /svgs/recontacting.svg
    summary: |
      By consenting to be part of this study you are consenting to be contacted in the future to be part of additional studies.
    description: |
      The research team may reach out to you in the future to see if you are interested in participating in future studies. Participation in future studies is optional.
  - title: Scientific Databases
    image: /svgs/scientific-databases.svg
    summary: |
      Some information from the analysis of your coded samples and your coded medical information like your age, sex, ethnic background, diagnosis and disease history, may be entered into one or more scientific databases available to other researchers inside and outside of Mount Sinai. Your identifiable information (e.g. name, phone number, medical record number) will never be added to a scientific database without your approval.

      The intervention being studied is designed to reduce stress, build resilience and improve mental well-being. Features of the study application and data we collect may help us understand who is most likely to benefit from this intervention in the future as we try to improve the psychological impact of COVID-19.
  - title: Potential Risks
    image: /svgs/risk.svg
    summary: |
      There always exists the potential for loss of private information.
    description: |
      There are procedures in place to minimize this risk. It is also possible that the application’s presence on your iPhone may be observed by someone other than the participant seeing an alert or reminder on their smartphone. Information on how we store your data may be found in the privacy section. 

      You may incur standard data charges when using our app, depending on your service carrier.

      There will be no penalty to you if you decide not to take part in this study. To stop being in the study at any time, delete the app from your phone and/or contact the study team by email. If you withdraw from the study, we will stop collecting new data, but any data already collected will remain as part of the study. The study team may also withdraw you from the study at any time for any reason. If you withdraw from the study you will be asked to return the Apple Watch and HeartMath sensor.
  - title: Confidentiality and Protected Information
    image: /svgs/confidentiality.svg

Protected Health Information (PHI) include, for example: your name, address, telephone number, medical record number, date of birth, family history, your medical record, blood draw sample, etc.

      Your health information, along with results of any tests/procedures collected as part of this research study or regular clinical care, will be used for this study as explained earlier in this consent process. The results of this study could be published or presented at scientific meetings, lectures, etc., but would not include any information that would let others know who you are, unless you give separate permission to do so. 
    description: |
      Consistent with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we are asking your permission to receive, use and share your Protected Health Information.

      Your authorization for the use of your protected health information for this specific study does not expire.

      The research team and other authorized members of The Mount Sinai Health System ("Mount Sinai") workforce may use and share your information to ensure that the research meets legal, institutional or accreditation requirements. For example, the School’s Program for the Protection of Human Subjects is responsible for overseeing research on human subjects and may need to see your information. If you receive any payments for taking part in this study, the Mount Sinai Finance Department may need your name, address, social security number, payment amount, and related information for tax reporting purposes.
