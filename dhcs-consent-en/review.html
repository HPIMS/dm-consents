    <h2>SUMMARY OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY:</h2>
    <p>
      In medicine there are many unanswered questions. A research study is when scientists try to answer
      a question about something that we don’t know enough about. Participation in a research study may
      or may not directly help you or others. Participation is entirely voluntary. It is completely up to you
      whether or not you take part. You can also change your mind at any time and it will not affect your
      ability to get medical care within the Mount Sinai Health System.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to learn more about your pain, stress and sleep symptoms on a daily
      basis. We are hoping to learn more about how these symptoms are interrelated and also how it
      affects more major health outcomes (such as a heart attack) in your health past or health future. You
      will have the option to connect any wearable device to the app, such as your Fitbit or Apple Watch.
      Information that wearable devices track, such as activity, heartrate, and sleep, can also help us
      understand how your symptoms related to pain, stress and sleep work together to affect your daily
      life.
      We a
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to integrate your digital (app) and clinical (medical record) data to track your symptoms and
      your health outcomes over time. By staying connected to the study and sharing data, we will learn
      more about you and your health. The more we know, the more accurately we may be able to
      recommend other digital studies at Mount Sinai that you may be eligible to participate in. We will also
      look at your behavior on the study/app (such as how long you spend on each page of the consent, or
      how long you spend taking the surveys) to assess the performance of our app/platform itself so we
      can make improvements to the app itself for you and everyone using it. This is similar to everyday
      commercial products to see how to make them work better for users or participants.
      Entering your data will allow you to track your health overtime, so this study app could be a useful tool
      for you if you are interested in tracking these symptoms in yourself.
    </p>
    <p>If you choose to participate, you will be asked to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Download and install the digital study platform</li>
      <li>
        Complete study surveys and tasks through the digital platform on a
        recurring basis
      </li>
      <li>
        (Optional) Share your electronic medical record with the study
      </li>
      <li>(Optional) Share data from your wearable device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The main risks to you if you choose to participate are the risk of loss of private information; this risk
      always exists, and there are procedures in place to minimize the risk as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>Participating in this research may not benefit you. The first 20 users of the application, who want one,
      will receive an apple watch or a Fitbit as a loan to track symptoms such as steps and heart rate, in real-
      time. You may not be eligible because the watches are all claimed, or you may decide you don’t want
      one to use. The choice is up to you. Other than this loan, you will not be compensated by the study.</p>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION OF WHAT’S INVOLVED:</h2>
    <p>
      If you agree to participate in this research study, the following
      information describes what may be involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon consenting for the study through your study app, you will be asked a series of baseline surveys.
      You will need to sync your wearables (if you choose) to this platform as directed in the study “set up”.
      There will be recurring activities taking place on the phone through the study application. You will be
      expected to complete the study surveys at the times you are prompted to, ranging from daily to weekly
      to monthly tasks all related to your pain, stress and sleep symptoms. Researchers of this study team
      may access your responses to surveys, such as your medical history survey, to see if you’re eligible to
      participate in other studies which utilize this digital platform and may be specific to you or your condition
      based on what we learn about you.

      <span class="bold">By signing this consent, you agree to be re-contacted for
potential participation in future studies. You may change this preference at any time in the app
settings.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">We will obtain your medical health information.</span>

      This can be controlled by you. We will share
      information through the app on how you can share your medical record information with us. If you do
      not wish to go through these steps, the study team will request it with your consent another way.

      <span class="bold">Before signing the consent, you can opt in to share your medical health information with the study team
by checking the box when prompted.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">We may send you a wearable device.</span>
      During the onboarding of this study, we are offering the first
      20 participants an apple watch or Fitbit to wear as a loan for the duration of your participation. You will
      have the option to use one or not. If you choose to, the Apple Watch or Fitbit will be shipped directly to
      you. You are expected to wear it devices at all times. The data from the devices will be uploaded into
      the digital study database so researchers can study it. You will not have to do anything besides install
      the devices at the start of the study and sync them with the digital study platform and make choices
      about which data you will share, aka steps, sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always when you set up the monitors and applications through the phone, you will have to agree to
      the different manufacturers’ terms and conditions and set up a unique account with each
      manufacturer. In doing so, you will be allowing their collection of some personal information like your
      name, email address, GPS coordinates and other technology specific data. The Apple Watch (as well
      as other devices like a Fitbit, if you sync it up with the study app) will measure physiological
      parameters (such as heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, temperature, and movement)
      and sleep related parameters (such as time in each sleep stage, time in bed, and # of wake ups a
      night). Some of this data will also include GPS, date, and time stamps. It is possible that Apple or
      Fitbit may be collecting some data through the information you provide on the research platform and if
      you chose to wear the Apple Watch or Fitbit. These companies could use the data that they collect to
      make money. This does not include health information, which is protected by this research study.
      There are data specific to the company’s terms and conditions which Apple and/or Fitbit has set up
      with you upon download and participation in the study application (or any application that you choose
      to download to your phone). We urge you to look over the terms of agreement with Apple/Fitbit to see
      what types of data they collect. The research team has no control over these device companies; ie.
      Apple, Fitbit and we don’t have any visibility into what data may be used, sold and shared and used
      for these companies to make profits through marketing and other initiatives. See software agreements here: Apple:

    <h2>USE OF YOUR DATA:</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, your identifiable information may be removed from the private information that are collected
      as part of this research. After this removal, the information could be used for future research studies or
      shared with other research teams for future research studies. You will not be informed of the details of
      specific research that is done with your medical information. That means that a research project might
      be done that you would not consent to if provided with the details of that research project. The future
      research may be related or unrelated to any of your medical conditions and your identity will always be
      linked to a code and not revealed, as we and any future researchers who may participate will not need
      to know who you are while using your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This study will limit sharing of data to only those databases, which are restricted and require approval
      to access. Researchers may be approved to do research related or unrelated to any of your medical
      conditions and you will not be notified. Please note that traditionally-used identifying information about
      you, such as your name, address, telephone number, or social security number, will NOT be put into
      these scientific databases.
    </p>
    <h2 class="bold underlined">Additional Future Digital Research Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      The study team may contact you about future digital research studies you qualify for based on the health
      information we learn about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be contacted about the study so you can decide if you want to participate and receive more
      information. There may be a new consent process just for that study. It may involve you signing up for
      additional studies within your study application because you were found to be eligible for additional
      digital studies. In both cases, this means we will have to look up the code to see who the data came
      from.
    </p>
    <p>
      By signing this consent form, you give researchers permission to <span class="bold">contact you</span> in the
      future to discuss

    <h2>REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:</h2>
    <h3 class="underlined">Privacy Risks</h3>
    <p>
      Risk of loss of private information; this risk always exists, but there are procedures in place to
      minimize the risk. The information you provide through the digital platform for the purposes of the
      research, does not contain your name or other identifiers. Therefore, no one outside of the DigiMe
      research team can access your name. There are procedures in place to further minimize this risk. For
      example, all data is stored on secured, password-protected servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or social security
      number) will never be placed into a public database.
    </p>
    <h3 class="underlined">Use of Devices</h3>
    <p>
      If you have been given a wearable device (such as an Apple Watch or a Fitbit) through the study and
      it has been damaged, you are obligated to let the study team know. We will send you a pre-paid label
      to send back the wearable if something happened to it and it is no longer working.
      If your device is lost or stolen you must notify the study team immediately. We will declare it lost or
      stolen with the wearable company.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your device is lost or stolen you must notify the study team immediately. We will declare it lost or
      stolen with the wearable company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third party use of your data as it applies to your wearable device and smartphone: As mentioned
      above and independent from this study and what you chose to share with the study team, your
      smartphone (ie. Apple, Samsung etc.) may be collecting data from you just because you are using an
      app on their device or wearable ie. Apple Watch. They may use your data, such as your GPS
      information to sell for profit. We urge you to please read over your smartphone and wearable
      company’s Terms and Conditions before you consent to this study to have an understanding of what
      data is being collected of you outside this research study.

      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we are asking your permission to receive, use
      and share that information.

      What protected health information is collected and used in this study, and might also be shared with
      others?
    </h5>
    <p>
      As part of this research project, the research team at the hospital(s) involved in the research will collect
      your name, address, medical records number, telephone number, dates related to you, and email
      address. The researchers will also get information from your electronic medical records and other
      sources as outlined above.
    </p>
    <h5 class="underlined">
      Why is your protected health information being used?
    </h5>
    <p>
      Your personal contact information is important to be able to contact you during the study. Your health
      information and the results of any tests and procedures being collected as part of this research study
      will be used for the purpose of this study as explained earlier in this consent form. The results of this
      study could be published or presented at scientific meetings, lectures, or other events, but would not
      include any information that would let others know who you are, unless you give separate permission
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The research team and other authorized members of The Mount Sinai Health System (“Mount Sinai”)
      workforce may use and share your information to ensure that the research meets legal, institutional or
      accreditation requirements. For example, the School’s Program for the Protection of Human Subjects
      is responsible for overseeing research on human subjects, and may need to see your information. If
      you receive any payments for taking part in this study, the Mount Sinai Finance Department may need
      your name, address, social security number, payment amount, and related information for tax reporting
      purposes. If the research team uncovers abuse, neglect, or reportable diseases, this information may
      be disclosed to appropriate authorities.
    </p>
    <h5 class="underlined">
      Who, outside Mount Sinai, might receive your protected health
      information?
    </h5>
    <p>
      As part of the study, the Principal Investigator, study team and others in the Mount Sinai workforce may
      disclose your protected health information, including the results of the research study tests and
      procedures, to the following people or organizations: (It is possible that there may be changes to the
      list during this research study; you may request an up-to-date list at any time by contacting the Principal
      Investigator.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the
        Office of Human Research Protection.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In almost all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, you will not be identified by name, social security
      number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier. Some records and
      information disclosed may be identified with a unique code number. The Principal Investigator will
      ensure that the key to the code will be kept in a locked file, or will be securely stored electronically.
      The code will not be used to link the information back to you without your permission, unless the
      Institutional Review Board allows it after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy.
      The Certificate of Confidentiality obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services will not
      be used to prevent disclosure to local authorities of child abuse and neglect, or harm to self or others.
      It is possible that a sponsor or their representatives, a data coordinating office, or a contract research
      organization, will come to inspect your records. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected the information leaving the institution will be stripped of direct identifiers. Additionally, the Office of
      Human Subjects Protection (OHRP) of the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be granted direct access to your medical records for
      verification of the research procedures and data. They are authorized to remove information with
      identifiers if necessary to complete their task. By signing this document you are authorizing this
      access. We may publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your name and other
      identifying information confidential.

    <h5 class="underlined">
      For how long will Mount Sinai be able to use or disclose your
      protected health information?
    </h5>
    <p>
      Your
      authorization for use of your protected health information for this specific study does not expire.
    </p>
    <h5 class="underlined">Will you be able to access your records?</h5>
    <p>
      During your participation in this study, you will have access to your medical record and any study
      information that is part of that record. The investigator is not required to release to you research
      information that is not part of your medical record.
    </p>
    <h5 class="underlined">
      Do you need to give us permission to obtain, use or share your health
      information?
    </h5>
    <p>
      NO! If you decide not to let us obtain, use or share your health information you should not sign this form,
      and you will not be allowed to volunteer in the research study.
      <span class="underlined"
      >If you do not sign, it will not affect your treatment, payment or
            enrollment in any health plans or affect your eligibility for
            benefits.</span

    <p>
      You may withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected information for
      research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page.
      Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use
      your protected information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the
      study. Your health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization if you
      should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from being in the study. If you withdraw your permission
      to use your protected health information for research that means you will also be withdrawn from the
      research study, but standard medical care and any other benefits to which you are entitled will not be
      affected. You can also tell us you want to withdraw from the research study at any time without canceling
      the Authorization to use your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important for you to understand that once information is disclosed to others outside Mount Sinai,
      the information may be re-disclosed and will no longer be covered by the federal privacy protection
      regulations. However, even if your information will no longer be protected by federal regulations, where
      possible, Mount Sinai has entered into agreements with those who will receive your information to
      continue to protect your confidentiality.

      If as part of this research project your medical records are being reviewed, or a medical history is being
      taken, it is possible that HIV-related information may be revealed to the researchers. If that is the case,
      the following information concerns you. If this research does not involve any review of medical records
      or questions about your medical history or conditions, then the following section may be ignored

      If you are authorizing the release of HIV-related information, you should be aware that the recipient(s) is
      (are) prohibited from re-disclosing any HIV-related information without your authorization unless permitted
      to do so under federal or state law. You also have a right to request a list of people who may receive or use
      your HIV-related information without authorization. If you experience discrimination because of the release
      or disclosure of HIV-related information, you may contact the New York State Division of Human Rights at
      (888) 392-3644 or the New York City Commission on Human Rights at (212) 306-5070. These agencies are

      Certificate of Confidentiality:
    </p>
    <p>
      To further protect your privacy, the researchers have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the
      Department of Health and Human Services. This is intended to ensure that your identity as a
      participant in this research study will not have to be disclosed as a result from a subpoena, for the
      purpose of identifying you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or
      other proceedings other than to the FDA or OHRP as identified above.
      The research staff will not share any of your research information or biospecimens with anyone who is
      not a member of the research team, including any family members or friends, other than to those
      identified above. However, you should know that if we learn that you or someone else is threatened
      with serious harm, such as a child or an elderly person being abused, the investigators may notify the
      appropriate authorities if necessary to protect you or others. A Certificate of Confidentiality does not
      prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your
      involvement in this research. This means that you and your family must also actively protect your own
      privacy. If an insurer or employer learns about your research participation, and you agree that they
      can have your research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate of
      Confidentiality to keep this information from them.
